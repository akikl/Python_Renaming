# Python_Renaming
This project involves the development of a Python automation script to streamline the process of renaming and organizing a large collection of image and document files. The script automatically creates individual folders for each file type and renames files based on user-defined document types.



- **Automation Script:** Designed and implemented a Python script to automate the file renaming and organization process, significantly reducing manual labor and human error.
- **Technologies Used:** Utilized Python and various libraries, including `os` for file handling to identify file types based on extensions.
- **User Interactivity:** Enabled user interactivity by prompting for a document type, allowing for custom naming conventions.
- **Robust Naming Scheme:** Implemented a robust naming scheme that includes a document category, document type, and a unique identifier (e.g., "DocumentCategory-DocumentType-H001").
- **Successful Processing:** Successfully processed and organized a collection of over [insert number] files, greatly enhancing data management and accessibility.
- **Problem-Solving and Attention to Detail:** Demonstrated problem-solving skills and attention to detail in creating an efficient automation solution.
